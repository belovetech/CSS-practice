        The fact that tourists may travel to experience such communities—if only at
        arm’s length, interpreted through a guide or by dint of an evening’s ‘staged
        authenticity’—has placed renewed emphasis on the relationship between
        community and locality. Tourists travel partly to consume difference, to see how
        other societies live. They can also be repulsed from districts regarded as
        dangerous or hostile because of the nature of the ‘community’ within. 
        There is,however, an assumption that differences can be experienced by travelling to
        specific locations which are associated with specific communities.
        The realisation that the community itself has become an object of tourism
        consumption has in turn encouraged some communities to reproduce
        themselves specifically for tourists.
